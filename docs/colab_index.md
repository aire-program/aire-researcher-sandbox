# Google Colab Launch Index  
This page provides one-click Google Colab launch links for key notebooks. All notebooks use fully synthetic data and mirror the internal AIRE deployment so external collaborators can follow the same workflows safely.

**What**: A jump list of Sandbox notebooks with Colab badges.  
**Why**: Enable rapid execution without local setup while keeping alignment with institutional guidance.  
**How**: Open a notebook, run the first setup cell, and execute cells in order; each notebook restates its What/Why/How and success criteria for clarity.

## Instructions
1. Click “Open in Colab.”
2. Run the first cell to install dependencies.
3. Execute all cells.

## Text Workflows
Normalize and prep article text for downstream NLP experiments.

## Retrieval-Augmented Workflows
Build and persist a TF-IDF index over synthetic abstracts.

Query the index with research-style questions and inspect rankings.

## Prototype Workflows
Prototype a lightweight research Q&A assistant powered by TF-IDF retrieval.

## API Examples
Exercise the synthetic REST client for GET/POST patterns.

_All notebooks rely on synthetic data generated by `scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py`. If you clone locally, run that script before executing notebooks outside Colab._
