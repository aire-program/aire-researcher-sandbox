# Overview

The AI Researcher Developer Sandbox is a key component of the AIRE Program at Michigan State University. It serves as a bridge between theoretical AI literacy and practical, hands-on application development for research.

## Purpose
The Sandbox provides a safe, controlled environment where researchers can:
- Experiment with AI tools without exposing sensitive data.
- Learn best practices for code organization and reproducibility.
- Prototype workflows that can later be scaled to high-performance computing clusters.

## Target Audience
- **Faculty**: Prototyping grant ideas and exploring new methodologies.
- **Graduate Students**: Building reproducible thesis workflows.
- **Research Staff**: Testing new tools and data pipelines.
