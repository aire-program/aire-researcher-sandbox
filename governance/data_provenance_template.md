# Data Provenance Record

**Institutional Requirement**: Complete this record for every dataset used in AIRE Program workflows to ensure traceability and reproducibility across internal and mirrored environments.

**What**: A structured log of dataset origin, processing, and stewardship.  
**Why**: Clear lineage supports auditability, ethical review, and reliable reuse.  
**How**: Fill each section before sharing results; store the completed record with the dataset and related notebooks.
