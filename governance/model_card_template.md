# Model Card

**Institutional Requirement**: Attach a completed Model Card to any model or algorithmic workflow released beyond the immediate research team.

**What**: A standardized summary of a model’s purpose, data, performance, and boundaries.  
**Why**: Consistent documentation supports responsible AI stewardship, review, and reuse across the AIRE Program.  
**How**: Populate each section before sharing outputs; store the card with code, notebooks, and data provenance records.

## Model Description
- **Name**:
- **Version**:
- **Type** (e.g., Transformer, Regression, Clustering):
- **Stewarding team/unit**:
- **Associated repositories or services**:

## Training or Input Data
- **Datasets used** (internal IDs or URLs):
- **Preprocessing steps** (cleaning, normalization, feature selection):
- **Data limitations or biases** (sampling constraints, synthetic mirrors):

## Intended Use
- **Primary use cases** (what problems the model is designed to address):
- **Intended users** (roles or teams):
- **Out-of-scope or prohibited uses** (where misuse could cause harm):

## Performance and Evaluation
- **Metrics reported** (e.g., accuracy, F1, Recall@K):
- **Evaluation data** (datasets, timeframes, synthetic vs. real indicators):
- **Known failure modes** (when performance degrades):

## Limitations and Risks
- **Technical limitations** (scalability, drift sensitivity, dependency constraints):
- **Operational risks** (uptime, version pinning, monitoring gaps):
- **Mitigations** (controls, fallback procedures, monitoring plans):

## Ethical Considerations
- **Fairness and bias review** (checks performed, findings):
- **Privacy and security** (data handling, access controls, logging):
- **Transparency and documentation** (links to provenance records, FAQs, user guidance):
