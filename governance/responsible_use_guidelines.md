# Responsible Use Guidelines

The AI Researcher Developer Sandbox is designed to support responsible AI adoption. Users are expected to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Transparency**: Always disclose the use of AI tools in research outputs.
2. **Accountability**: Verify AI-generated outputs; do not rely solely on automated systems for critical decisions.
3. **Privacy**: Do not upload sensitive or restricted data to public or unapproved AI services.
4. **Fairness**: Be aware of potential biases in models and data; test for disparate impact.
5. **Reproducibility**: Document workflows, seeds, and versions to ensure research reproducibility.
6. **Compliance**: Follow all institutional and legal requirements regarding data handling and research ethics.

These guidelines align with the broader AIRE Program mission to foster ethical and effective AI integration.
